# Convert and Compare
This project is an interactive webpage made with Glitch.com's IDE and an API from https://www.exchangerate-api.com/. It features a currency converter in which the user inputs a value amount, a base currency, and a currency to change over to, and receives the amount value in the new currency. Below the converter are bar charts made with d3 that display the base currency in the context of other currencies, to let users learn more about the high variability and breadth of currencies around the world.
